# Pre-requirements

- Be comfortable with the Linux command line

  - navigating directories

  - editing files

  - a little bit of bash-fu (environment variables, loops)

- It's totally OK if you are not a Linux expert!

## Hands-on sections

- The whole workshop is hands-on

- We are going to build, ship, and run containers!

- All hands-on sections are clearly identified, like the gray rectangle below

## Play with Docker: https://labs.play-with-docker.com/

- Each person gets a private cluster of cloud VMs (not shared with anybody else)

- They'll remain up for 4 hours

- You can automatically SSH from one VM to another

- The nodes have aliases: `node1`, `node2`, etc.

## Why don't we run containers locally?

- Installing this stuff can be hard on some machines

  (32 bits CPU or OS... Laptops without administrator access... etc.)

- All you need is a computer (or even a phone or tablet!), with:

  - an internet connection

  - a web browser

  - an SSH client

.debug[[shared/prereqs.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/shared/prereqs.md)]
---

class: in-person

## SSH clients

- On Linux, OS X, FreeBSD... you are probably all set

- On Windows, get one of these:

  - [putty](http://www.putty.org/)
  - Microsoft [Win32 OpenSSH](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/Install-Win32-OpenSSH)
  - [Git BASH](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)
  - [MobaXterm](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)

- Nice-to-have: [Mosh](https://mosh.org/) instead of SSH, if your internet connection tends to lose packets

# Docker Overview

* The software industry has changed

* Before:
  * monolithic applications
  * long development cycles
  * single environment
  * slowly scaling up

* Now:
  * decoupled services
  * fast, iterative improvements
  * multiple environments
  * quickly scaling out

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Deployment becomes very complex

* Many different stacks:
  * languages
  * frameworks
  * databases

* Many different targets:
  * individual development environments
  * pre-production, QA, staging...
  * production: on prem, cloud, hybrid

## Escape dependency hell

1. Write installation instructions into an `INSTALL.txt` file

2. Turn this file into a `Dockerfile`, test it on your machine

3. If the Dockerfile builds on your machine, it will build *anywhere*

4. Rejoice as you escape dependency hell and "works on my machine"

Never again "worked in dev - ops problem now!"

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## On-board developers and contributors rapidly

1. Write Dockerfiles for your application components

2. Use pre-made images from the Docker Hub (mysql, redis...)

3. Describe your stack with a Compose file

4. On-board somebody with two commands:

```bash
git clone ...
docker-compose up
```

With this, you can create development, integration, QA environments in minutes!

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Implement reliable CI easily

1. Build test environment with a Dockerfile or Compose file

2. For each test run, stage up a new container or stack

3. Each run is now in a clean environment

4. No pollution from previous tests

Way faster and cheaper than creating VMs each time!

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Use container images as build artefacts

1. Build your app from Dockerfiles

2. Store the resulting images in a registry

3. Keep them forever (or as long as necessary)

4. Test those images in QA, CI, integration...

5. Run the same images in production

6. Something goes wrong? Rollback to previous image

7. Investigating old regression? Old image has your back!

Images contain all the libraries, dependencies, etc. needed to run the app.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Decouple "plumbing" from application logic

1. Write your code to connect to named services ("db", "api"...)

2. Use Compose to start your stack

3. Docker will setup per-container DNS resolver for those names

4. You can now scale, add load balancers, replication ... without changing your code

Note: this is not covered in this intro level workshop!

## What did Docker bring to the table?

### Docker before/after

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Formats and APIs, before Docker

* No standardized exchange format.
  <br/>(No, a rootfs tarball is *not* a format!)

* Containers are hard to use for developers.
  <br/>(Where's the equivalent of `docker run debian`?)

* As a result, they are *hidden* from the end users.

* No re-usable components, APIs, tools.
  <br/>(At best: VM abstractions, e.g. libvirt.)

Analogy: 

* Shipping containers are not just steel boxes.
* They are steel boxes that are a standard size, with the same hooks and holes.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Formats and APIs, after Docker

* Standardize the container format, because containers were not portable.

* Make containers easy to use for developers.

* Emphasis on re-usable components, APIs, ecosystem of standard tools.

* Improvement over ad-hoc, in-house, specific tools.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Shipping, before Docker

* Ship packages: deb, rpm, gem, jar, homebrew...

* Dependency hell.

* "Works on my machine."

* Base deployment often done from scratch (debootstrap...) and unreliable.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Shipping, after Docker

* Ship container images with all their dependencies.

* Images are bigger, but they are broken down into layers.

* Only ship layers that have changed.

* Save disk, network, memory usage.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Example

Layers:

* CentOS
* JRE
* Tomcat
* Dependencies
* Application JAR
* Configuration

## Devs vs Ops, before Docker

* Drop a tarball (or a commit hash) with instructions.

* Dev environment very different from production.

* Ops don't always have a dev environment themselves ...

* ... and when they do, it can differ from the devs'.

* Ops have to sort out differences and make it work ...

* ... or bounce it back to devs.

* Shipping code causes frictions and delays.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Devs vs Ops, after Docker

* Drop a container image or a Compose file.

* Ops can always run that container image.

* Ops can always run that Compose file.

* Ops still have to adapt to prod environment,
  but at least they have a reference point.

* Ops have tools allowing to use the same image
  in dev and prod.

* Devs can be empowered to make releases themselves
  more easily.

## What *is* Docker?

- "Installing Docker" really means "Installing the Docker Engine and CLI".

- The Docker Engine is a daemon (a service running in the background).

- This daemon manages containers, the same way that a hypervisor manages VMs.

- We interact with the Docker Engine by using the Docker CLI.

- The Docker CLI and the Docker Engine communicate through an API.

- There are many other programs and client libraries which use that API.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Why don't we run Docker locally?

- We are going to download container images and distribution packages.

- This could put a bit of stress on the local machines and slow us down.

- Instead, we use a remote VM environment that has a good connectivity

- In some rare cases, installing Docker locally is challenging:

  - no administrator/root access (computer managed by strict corp IT)

  - 32-bit CPU or OS

  - old OS version (e.g. CentOS 6, OSX pre-Yosemite, Windows 7)

- It's better to spend time learning containers than fiddling with the installer!

## Installing Docker

![install](images/title-installing-docker.jpg)

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Objectives

At the end of this lesson, you will know:

* How to install Docker.

* When to use `sudo` when running Docker commands.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Installing Docker

There are many ways to install Docker.

We can arbitrarily distinguish:

* Installing Docker on an existing Linux machine (physical or VM)

* Installing Docker on macOS or Windows

* Installing Docker on a fleet of cloud VMs

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Installing Docker on Linux

* The recommended method is to install the packages supplied by Docker Inc :

  - add Docker Inc.'s package repositories to your system configuration

  - install the Docker Engine

* Detailed installation instructions (distro by distro) are available on:

  https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/

* You can also install from binaries (if your distro is not supported):

  https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/binaries/

* To quickly setup a dev environment, Docker provides a convenience install script:

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL get.docker.com | sh
  ```

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Docker Inc. packages vs distribution packages

* Docker Inc. releases new versions monthly (edge) and quarterly (stable)

* Releases are immediately available on Docker Inc.'s package repositories

* Linux distros don't always update to the latest Docker version

  (Sometimes, updating would break their guidelines for major/minor upgrades)

* Sometimes, some distros have carried packages with custom patches

* Sometimes, these patches added critical security bugs ☹

* Installing through Docker Inc.'s repositories is a bit of extra work …

  … but it is generally worth it!

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Docker Desktop

* Special Docker edition available for Mac and Windows

* Integrates well with the host OS:

  * installed like normal user applications on the host

  * provides user-friendly GUI to edit Docker configuration and settings

* Only support running one Docker VM at a time ...

  ... but we can use `docker-machine`, VirtualBox, etc. to get a cluster.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Running Docker on macOS and Windows

When you execute `docker version` from the terminal:

* the CLI connects to the Docker Engine over a standard socket,
* the Docker Engine is, in fact, running in a VM,
* ... but the CLI doesn't know or care about that,
* the CLI sends a request using the REST API,
* the Docker Engine in the VM processes the request,
* the CLI gets the response and displays it to you.

All communication with the Docker Engine happens over the API.

This will also allow to use remote Engines exactly as if they were local.

## Our first containers

![Colorful plastic tubs](images/title-our-first-containers.jpg)

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Objectives

At the end of this lesson, you will have:

* Seen Docker in action.

* Started your first containers.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Hello World

In your Docker environment, just run the following command:

```bash
$ docker run busybox echo hello world
hello world
```

(If your Docker install is brand new, you will also see a few extra lines,
corresponding to the download of the `busybox` image.)

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## That was our first container!

* We used one of the smallest, simplest images available: `busybox`.

* `busybox` is typically used in embedded systems (phones, routers...)

* We ran a single process and echo'ed `hello world`.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## A more useful container

Let's run a more exciting container:

```bash
$ docker run -it ubuntu
root@04c0bb0a6c07:/#
```

* This is a brand new container.

* It runs a bare-bones, no-frills `ubuntu` system.

* `-it` is shorthand for `-i -t`.

  * `-i` tells Docker to connect us to the container's stdin.

  * `-t` tells Docker that we want a pseudo-terminal.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Do something in our container

Try to run `figlet` in our container.

```bash
root@04c0bb0a6c07:/# figlet hello
bash: figlet: command not found
```

Alright, we need to install it.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Install a package in our container

We want `figlet`, so let's install it:

```bash
root@04c0bb0a6c07:/# apt-get update
...
Fetched 1514 kB in 14s (103 kB/s)
Reading package lists... Done
root@04c0bb0a6c07:/# apt-get install figlet
Reading package lists... Done
...
```

One minute later, `figlet` is installed!

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Try to run our freshly installed program

The `figlet` program takes a message as parameter.

```bash
root@04c0bb0a6c07:/# figlet hello
 _          _ _       
| |__   ___| | | ___  
| '_ \ / _ \ | |/ _ \

## Counting packages in the container

Let's check how many packages are installed there.

```bash
root@04c0bb0a6c07:/# dpkg -l | wc -l
190
```

* `dpkg -l` lists the packages installed in our container

* `wc -l` counts them

How many packages do we have on our host?

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

class: in-person

## Counting packages on the host

Exit the container by logging out of the shell, like you would usually do.

(E.g. with `^D` or `exit`)

```bash
root@04c0bb0a6c07:/# exit
```

Now, try to:

* run `dpkg -l | wc -l`. How many packages are installed?

* run `figlet`. Does that work?

## Comparing the container and the host

Exit the container by logging out of the shell, with `^D` or `exit`.

Now try to run `figlet`. Does that work?

(It shouldn't; except if, by coincidence, you are running on a machine where figlet was installed before.)

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Host and containers are independent things

* We ran an `ubuntu` container on an Linux/Windows/macOS host.

* They have different, independent packages.

* Installing something on the host doesn't expose it to the container.

* And vice-versa.

* Even if both the host and the container have the same Linux distro!

* We can run *any container* on *any host*.

  (One exception: Windows containers cannot run on Linux machines; at least not yet.)

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Where's our container?

* Our container is now in a *stopped* state.

* It still exists on disk, but all compute resources have been freed up.

* We will see later how to get back to that container.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Starting another container

What if we start a new container, and try to run `figlet` again?
 
```bash
$ docker run -it ubuntu
root@b13c164401fb:/# figlet
bash: figlet: command not found
```

* We started a *brand new container*.

* The basic Ubuntu image was used, and `figlet` is not here.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Where's my container?

* Can we reuse that container that we took time to customize?

  *We can, but that's not the default workflow with Docker.*

* What's the default workflow, then?

  *Always start with a fresh container.*
  <br/>
  *If we need something installed in our container, build a custom image.*

* That seems complicated!

  *We'll see that it's actually pretty easy!*

* And what's the point?

  *This puts a strong emphasis on automation and repeatability. Let's see why ...*

## Pets vs. Cattle

* In the "pets vs. cattle" metaphor, there are two kinds of servers.

* Pets:

  * have distinctive names and unique configurations

  * when they have an outage, we do everything we can to fix them

* Cattle:

  * have generic names (e.g. with numbers) and generic configuration

  * configuration is enforced by configuration management, golden images ...

  * when they have an outage, we can replace them immediately with a new server

* What's the connection with Docker and containers?

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Local development environments

* When we use local VMs (with e.g. VirtualBox or VMware), our workflow looks like this:

  * create VM from base template (Ubuntu, CentOS...)

  * install packages, set up environment

  * work on project

  * when done, shut down VM

  * next time we need to work on project, restart VM as we left it

  * if we need to tweak the environment, we do it live

* Over time, the VM configuration evolves, diverges.

* We don't have a clean, reliable, deterministic way to provision that environment.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Local development with Docker

* With Docker, the workflow looks like this:

  * create container image with our dev environment

  * run container with that image

  * work on project

  * when done, shut down container

  * next time we need to work on project, start a new container

  * if we need to tweak the environment, we create a new image

* We have a clear definition of our environment, and can share it reliably with others.

* Let's see in the next chapters how to bake a custom image with `figlet`!

## Background containers

![Background containers](images/title-background-containers.jpg)

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Objectives

Our first containers were *interactive*.

We will now see how to:

* Run a non-interactive container.
* Run a container in the background.
* List running containers.
* Check the logs of a container.
* Stop a container.
* List stopped containers.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## A non-interactive container

We will run a small custom container.

This container just displays the time every second.

```bash
$ docker run ahmedgabercod/clock
Fri Feb 20 00:28:53 UTC 2015
Fri Feb 20 00:28:54 UTC 2015
Fri Feb 20 00:28:55 UTC 2015
...
```

* This container will run forever.
* To stop it, press `^C`.
* Docker has automatically downloaded the image `ahmedgabercod/clock`.
* This image is a user image, created by `ahmedgabercod`.
* We will hear more about user images (and other types of images) later.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Run a container in the background

Containers can be started in the background, with the `-d` flag (daemon mode):

```bash
$ docker run -d ahmedgabercod/clock
47d677dcfba4277c6cc68fcaa51f932b544cab1a187c853b7d0caf4e8debe5ad
```

* We don't see the output of the container.
* But don't worry: Docker collects that output and logs it!
* Docker gives us the ID of the container.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## List running containers

How can we check that our container is still running?

With `docker ps`, just like the UNIX `ps` command, lists running processes.

```bash
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE           ...  CREATED        STATUS        ...
47d677dcfba4  ahmedgabercod/clock  ...  2 minutes ago  Up 2 minutes  ...
```

Docker tells us:

* The (truncated) ID of our container.
* The image used to start the container.
* That our container has been running (`Up`) for a couple of minutes.
* Other information (COMMAND, PORTS, NAMES) that we will explain later.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Starting more containers

Let's start two more containers.

```bash
$ docker run -d ahmedgabercod/clock
57ad9bdfc06bb4407c47220cf59ce21585dce9a1298d7a67488359aeaea8ae2a
```

```bash
$ docker run -d ahmedgabercod/clock
068cc994ffd0190bbe025ba74e4c0771a5d8f14734af772ddee8dc1aaf20567d
```

Check that `docker ps` correctly reports all 3 containers.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Viewing only the last container started

When many containers are already running, it can be useful to
see only the last container that was started.

This can be achieved with the `-l` ("Last") flag:

```bash
$ docker ps -l
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE           ...  CREATED        STATUS        ...
068cc994ffd0  ahmedgabercod/clock  ...  2 minutes ago  Up 2 minutes  ...
```

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## View only the IDs of the containers

Many Docker commands will work on container IDs: `docker stop`, `docker rm`...

If we want to list only the IDs of our containers (without the other columns
or the header line),
we can use the `-q` ("Quiet", "Quick") flag:

```bash
$ docker ps -q
068cc994ffd0
57ad9bdfc06b
47d677dcfba4
```

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Combining flags

We can combine `-l` and `-q` to see only the ID of the last container started:

```bash
$ docker ps -lq
068cc994ffd0
```

At a first glance, it looks like this would be particularly useful in scripts.

However, if we want to start a container and get its ID in a reliable way,
it is better to use `docker run -d`, which we will cover in a bit.

(Using `docker ps -lq` is prone to race conditions: what happens if someone
else, or another program or script, starts another container just before
we run `docker ps -lq`?)

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## View the logs of a container

We told you that Docker was logging the container output.

Let's see that now.

```bash
$ docker logs 068
Fri Feb 20 00:39:52 UTC 2015
Fri Feb 20 00:39:53 UTC 2015
...
```

* We specified a *prefix* of the full container ID.
* You can, of course, specify the full ID.
* The `logs` command will output the *entire* logs of the container.
  <br/>(Sometimes, that will be too much. Let's see how to address that.)

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## View only the tail of the logs

To avoid being spammed with eleventy pages of output,
we can use the `--tail` option:

```bash
$ docker logs --tail 3 068
Fri Feb 20 00:55:35 UTC 2015
Fri Feb 20 00:55:36 UTC 2015
Fri Feb 20 00:55:37 UTC 2015
```

* The parameter is the number of lines that we want to see.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Follow the logs in real time

Just like with the standard UNIX command `tail -f`, we can
follow the logs of our container:

```bash
$ docker logs --tail 1 --follow 068
Fri Feb 20 00:57:12 UTC 2015
Fri Feb 20 00:57:13 UTC 2015
^C
```

* This will display the last line in the log file.
* Then, it will continue to display the logs in real time.
* Use `^C` to exit.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Stop our container

There are two ways we can terminate our detached container.

* Killing it using the `docker kill` command.
* Stopping it using the `docker stop` command.

The first one stops the container immediately, by using the
`KILL` signal.

The second one is more graceful. It sends a `TERM` signal,
and after 10 seconds, if the container has not stopped, it
sends `KILL.`

Reminder: the `KILL` signal cannot be intercepted, and will
forcibly terminate the container.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Stopping our containers

Let's stop one of those containers:

```bash
$ docker stop 47d6
47d6
```

This will take 10 seconds:

* Docker sends the TERM signal;
* the container doesn't react to this signal
  (it's a simple Shell script with no special
  signal handling);
* 10 seconds later, since the container is still
  running, Docker sends the KILL signal;
* this terminates the container.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Killing the remaining containers

Let's be less patient with the two other containers:

```bash
$ docker kill 068 57ad
068
57ad
```

The `stop` and `kill` commands can take multiple container IDs.

Those containers will be terminated immediately (without
the 10-second delay).

Let's check that our containers don't show up anymore:

```bash
$ docker ps
```

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## List stopped containers

We can also see stopped containers, with the `-a` (`--all`) option.

```bash
$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE           ...  CREATED      STATUS
068cc994ffd0  ahmedgabercod/clock  ...  21 min. ago  Exited (137) 3 min. ago

47d677dcfba4  ahmedgabercod/clock  ...  23 min. ago  Exited (137) 3 min. ago
5c1dfd4d81f1  ahmedgabercod/clock  ...  40 min. ago  Exited (0) 40 min. ago
b13c164401fb  ubuntu          ...  55 min. ago  Exited (130) 53 min. ago

## Restarting and attaching to containers

We have started containers in the foreground, and in the background.

In this chapter, we will see how to:

* Put a container in the background.
* Attach to a background container to bring it to the foreground.
* Restart a stopped container.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Background and foreground

The distinction between foreground and background containers is arbitrary.

From Docker's point of view, all containers are the same.

All containers run the same way, whether there is a client attached to them or not.

It is always possible to detach from a container, and to reattach to a container.

Analogy: attaching to a container is like plugging a keyboard and screen to a physical server.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Detaching from a container (Linux/macOS)

* If you have started an *interactive* container (with option `-it`), you can detach from it.

* The "detach" sequence is `^P^Q`.

* Otherwise you can detach by killing the Docker client.
  
  (But not by hitting `^C`, as this would deliver `SIGINT` to the container.)

What does `-it` stand for?

* `-t` means "allocate a terminal."
* `-i` means "connect stdin to the terminal."

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Detaching cont. (Win PowerShell and cmd.exe)

* Docker for Windows has a different detach experience due to shell features.

* `^P^Q` does not work.

* `^C` will detach, rather than stop the container.

* Using Bash, Subsystem for Linux, etc. on Windows behaves like Linux/macOS shells.

* Both PowerShell and Bash work well in Win 10; just be aware of differences.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Specifying a custom detach sequence

* You don't like `^P^Q`? No problem!
* You can change the sequence with `docker run --detach-keys`.
* This can also be passed as a global option to the engine.

Start a container with a custom detach command:

```bash
$ docker run -ti --detach-keys ctrl-x,x ahmedgabercod/clock
```

Detach by hitting `^X x`. (This is ctrl-x then x, not ctrl-x twice!)

Check that our container is still running:

```bash
$ docker ps -l
```

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Attaching to a container

You can attach to a container:

```bash
$ docker attach <containerID>
```

* The container must be running.
* There *can* be multiple clients attached to the same container.
* If you don't specify `--detach-keys` when attaching, it defaults back to `^P^Q`.

Try it on our previous container:

```bash
$ docker attach $(docker ps -lq)
```

Check that `^X x` doesn't work, but `^P ^Q` does.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Detaching from non-interactive containers

* **Warning:** if the container was started without `-it`...

  * You won't be able to detach with `^P^Q`.
  * If you hit `^C`, the signal will be proxied to the container.

* Remember: you can always detach by killing the Docker client.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Checking container output

* Use `docker attach` if you intend to send input to the container.

* If you just want to see the output of a container, use `docker logs`.

```bash
$ docker logs --tail 1 --follow <containerID>
```

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Restarting a container

When a container has exited, it is in stopped state.

It can then be restarted with the `start` command.

```bash
$ docker start <yourContainerID>
```

The container will be restarted using the same options you launched it
with.

You can re-attach to it if you want to interact with it:

```bash
$ docker attach <yourContainerID>
```

Use `docker ps -a` to identify the container ID of a previous `ahmedgabercod/clock` container,
and try those commands.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Attaching to a REPL

* REPL = Read Eval Print Loop

* Shells, interpreters, TUI ...

* Symptom: you `docker attach`, and see nothing

* The REPL doesn't know that you just attached, and doesn't print anything

* Try hitting `^L` or `Enter`

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## SIGWINCH

* When you `docker attach`, the Docker Engine sends SIGWINCH signals to the container.

* SIGWINCH = WINdow CHange; indicates a change in window size.

* This will cause some CLI and TUI programs to redraw the screen.

* But not all of them.

## Naming and inspecting containers

![Markings on container door](images/title-naming-and-inspecting-containers.jpg)

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Objectives

Docker concept: container *naming*.

Naming allows us to:

* Reference easily a container.

* Ensure unicity of a specific container.

We will also see the `inspect` command, which gives a lot of details about a container.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Naming our containers

So far, we have referenced containers with their ID.

We have copy-pasted the ID, or used a shortened prefix.

But each container can also be referenced by its name.

If a container is named `thumbnail-worker`, I can do:

```bash
$ docker logs thumbnail-worker
$ docker stop thumbnail-worker
etc.
```

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Default names

When we create a container, if we don't give a specific
name, Docker will pick one for us.

It will be the concatenation of:

* A mood (furious, goofy, suspicious, boring...)

* The name of a famous inventor (tesla, darwin, wozniak...)

Examples: `happy_curie`, `clever_hopper`, `jovial_lovelace` ...

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Specifying a name

You can set the name of the container when you create it.

```bash
$ docker run --name ticktock ahmedgabercod/clock
```

If you specify a name that already exists, Docker will refuse
to create the container.

This lets us enforce unicity of a given resource.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Renaming containers

* You can rename containers with `docker rename`.

* This allows you to "free up" a name without destroying the associated container.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Inspecting a container

The `docker inspect` command will output a very detailed JSON map.

```bash
$ docker inspect <containerID>
[{
...
(many pages of JSON here)
...
```

There are multiple ways to consume that information.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Parsing JSON with the Shell

* You *could* grep and cut or awk the output of `docker inspect`.

* Please, don't.

* It's painful.

* If you really must parse JSON from the Shell, use JQ! (It's great.)

```bash
$ docker inspect <containerID> | jq .
```

* We will see a better solution which doesn't require extra tools.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Using `--format`

You can specify a format string, which will be parsed by 
Go's text/template package.

```bash
$ docker inspect --format '{{ json .Created }}' <containerID>
"2015-02-24T07:21:11.712240394Z"
```

* The generic syntax is to wrap the expression with double curly braces.

* The expression starts with a dot representing the JSON object.

* Then each field or member can be accessed in dotted notation syntax.

* The optional `json` keyword asks for valid JSON output.
  <br/>(e.g. here it adds the surrounding double-quotes.)

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Labels

* Labels allow to attach arbitrary metadata to containers.

* Labels are key/value pairs.

* They are specified at container creation.

* You can query them with `docker inspect`.

* They can also be used as filters with some commands (e.g. `docker ps`).

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Using labels

Let's create a few containers with a label `owner`.

```bash
docker run -d -l owner=alice nginx
docker run -d -l owner=bob nginx
docker run -d -l owner nginx
```

We didn't specify a value for the `owner` label in the last example.

This is equivalent to setting the value to be an empty string.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Querying labels

We can view the labels with `docker inspect`.

```bash
$ docker inspect $(docker ps -lq) | grep -A3 Labels
            "Labels": {
                "maintainer": "NGINX Docker Maintainers <docker-maint@nginx.com>",
                "owner": ""
            },
```

We can use the `--format` flag to list the value of a label.

```bash
$ docker inspect $(docker ps -q) --format 'OWNER={{.Config.Labels.owner}}'
```

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Using labels to select containers

We can list containers having a specific label.

```bash
$ docker ps --filter label=owner
```

Or we can list containers having a specific label with a specific value.

```bash
$ docker ps --filter label=owner=alice
```

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Use-cases for labels


* HTTP vhost of a web app or web service.

  (The label is used to generate the configuration for NGINX, HAProxy, etc.)

* Backup schedule for a stateful service.

  (The label is used by a cron job to determine if/when to backup container data.)

* Service ownership.

  (To determine internal cross-billing, or who to page in case of outage.)

* etc.

## Getting inside a container

![Person standing inside a container](images/getting-inside.png)

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Objectives

On a traditional server or VM, we sometimes need to:

* log into the machine (with SSH or on the console),

* analyze the disks (by removing them or rebooting with a rescue system).

In this chapter, we will see how to do that with containers.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Getting a shell

Every once in a while, we want to log into a machine.

In an perfect world, this shouldn't be necessary.

* You need to install or update packages (and their configuration)?

  Use configuration management. (e.g. Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Salt...)

* You need to view logs and metrics?

  Collect and access them through a centralized platform.

In the real world, though ... we often need shell access!

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Not getting a shell

Even without a perfect deployment system, we can do many operations without getting a shell.

* Installing packages can (and should) be done in the container image.

* Configuration can be done at the image level, or when the container starts.

* Dynamic configuration can be stored in a volume (shared with another container).

* Logs written to stdout are automatically collected by the Docker Engine.

* Other logs can be written to a shared volume.

* Process information and metrics are visible from the host.

_Let's save logging, volumes ... for later, but let's have a look at process information!_

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Viewing container processes from the host

If you run Docker on Linux, container processes are visible on the host.

```bash
$ ps faux | less
```

* Scroll around the output of this command.

* You should see the `ahmedgabercod/clock` container.

* A containerized process is just like any other process on the host.

* We can use tools like `lsof`, `strace`, `gdb` ... To analyze them.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## What's the difference between a container process and a host process?

* Each process (containerized or not) belongs to *namespaces* and *cgroups*.

* The namespaces and cgroups determine what a process can "see" and "do".

* Analogy: each process (containerized or not) runs with a specific UID (user ID).

* UID=0 is root, and has elevated privileges. Other UIDs are normal users.

_We will give more details about namespaces and cgroups later._

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Getting a shell in a running container

* Sometimes, we need to get a shell anyway.

* We _could_ run some SSH server in the container ...

* But it is easier to use `docker exec`.

```bash
$ docker exec -ti ticktock sh
```

* This creates a new process (running `sh`) _inside_ the container.

* This can also be done "manually" with the tool `nsenter`.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Caveats

* The tool that you want to run needs to exist in the container.

* Some tools (like `ip netns exec`) let you attach to _one_ namespace at a time.

  (This lets you e.g. setup network interfaces, even if you don't have `ifconfig` or `ip` in the container.)

* Most importantly: the container needs to be running.

* What if the container is stopped or crashed?

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Getting a shell in a stopped container

* A stopped container is only _storage_ (like a disk drive).

* We cannot SSH into a disk drive or USB stick!

* We need to connect the disk to a running machine.

* How does that translate into the container world?

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Analyzing a stopped container

As an exercise, we are going to try to find out what's wrong with `ahmedgabercod/crashtest`.

```bash
docker run ahmedgabercod/crashtest
```

The container starts, but then stops immediately, without any output.

What would MacGyver&trade; do?

First, let's check the status of that container.

```bash
docker ps -l
```

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Viewing filesystem changes

* We can use `docker diff` to see files that were added / changed / removed.

```bash
docker diff <container_id>
```

* The container ID was shown by `docker ps -l`.

* We can also see it with `docker ps -lq`.

* The output of `docker diff` shows some interesting log files!

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

## Accessing files

* We can extract files with `docker cp`.

```bash
docker cp <container_id>:/var/log/nginx/error.log .
```

* Then we can look at that log file.

```bash
cat error.log
```

(The directory `/run/nginx` doesn't exist.)

class: extra-details

## Exploring a crashed container

* We can restart a container with `docker start` ...

* ... But it will probably crash again immediately!

* We cannot specify a different program to run with `docker start`

* But we can create a new image from the crashed container

```bash
docker commit <container_id> debugimage
```

* Then we can run a new container from that image, with a custom entrypoint

```bash
docker run -ti --entrypoint sh debugimage
```

.debug[[containers/Docker_Overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Overview.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Obtaining a complete dump

* We can also dump the entire filesystem of a container.

* This is done with `docker export`.

* It generates a tar archive.

```bash
docker export <container_id> | tar tv
```

This will give a detailed listing of the content of the container.

# Understanding Docker images

---

## Objectives

In this section, we will explain:

* What is an image.

* What is a layer.

* The various image namespaces.

* How to search and download images.

* Image tags and when to use them.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## What is an image?

* Image = files + metadata

* These files form the root filesystem of our container.

* The metadata can indicate a number of things, e.g.:

  * the author of the image
  * the command to execute in the container when starting it
  * environment variables to be set
  * etc.

* Images are made of *layers*, conceptually stacked on top of each other.

* Each layer can add, change, and remove files and/or metadata.

* Images can share layers to optimize disk usage, transfer times, and memory use.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Example for a Java webapp

Each of the following items will correspond to one layer:

* CentOS base layer
* Packages and configuration files added by our local IT
* JRE
* Tomcat
* Our application's dependencies
* Our application code and assets
* Our application configuration

## The read-write layer

![layers](images/container-layers.jpg)

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Differences between containers and images

* An image is a read-only filesystem.

* A container is an encapsulated set of processes,

  running in a read-write copy of that filesystem.

* To optimize container boot time, *copy-on-write* is used
  instead of regular copy.

* `docker run` starts a container from a given image.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]

## Multiple containers sharing the same image

![layers](images/sharing-layers.jpg)

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Images namespaces

There are three namespaces:

* Official images

    e.g. `ubuntu`, `busybox` ...

* User (and organizations) images

    e.g. `ahmedgabercod/clock`

* Self-hosted images

    e.g. `registry.example.com:5000/my-private/image`

Let's explain each of them.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Root namespace

The root namespace is for official images.

They are gated by Docker Inc.

They are generally authored and maintained by third parties.

Those images include:

* Small, "swiss-army-knife" images like busybox.

* Distro images to be used as bases for your builds, like ubuntu, fedora...

* Ready-to-use components and services, like redis, postgresql...

* Over 150 at this point!

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## User namespace

The user namespace holds images for Docker Hub users and organizations.

For example:

```bash
ahmedgabercod/clock
```

The Docker Hub user is:

```bash
ahmedgabercod
```

The image name is:

```bash
clock
```

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Self-hosted namespace

This namespace holds images which are not hosted on Docker Hub, but on third
party registries.

They contain the hostname (or IP address), and optionally the port, of the
registry server.

For example:

```bash
localhost:5000/wordpress
```

* `localhost:5000` is the host and port of the registry
* `wordpress` is the name of the image

Other examples:

```bash
quay.io/coreos/etcd
gcr.io/google-containers/hugo
```

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## How do you store and manage images?

Images can be stored:

* On your Docker host.
* In a Docker registry.

You can use the Docker client to download (pull) or upload (push) images.

To be more accurate: you can use the Docker client to tell a Docker Engine
to push and pull images to and from a registry.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Showing current images

Let's look at what images are on our host now.

```bash
$ docker images
REPOSITORY       TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
fedora           latest    ddd5c9c1d0f2   3 days ago      204.7 MB
centos           latest    d0e7f81ca65c   3 days ago      196.6 MB
ubuntu           latest    07c86167cdc4   4 days ago      188 MB
redis            latest    4f5f397d4b7c   5 days ago      177.6 MB

ahmedgabercod/clock   latest    12068b93616f   12 months ago   2.433 MB
```

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Searching for images

We cannot list *all* images on a remote registry, but
we can search for a specific keyword:

```bash
$ docker search marathon
NAME                     DESCRIPTION                     STARS  OFFICIAL  AUTOMATED
mesosphere/marathon      A cluster-wide init and co...   105              [OK]
mesoscloud/marathon      Marathon                        31               [OK]
mesosphere/marathon-lb   Script to update haproxy b...   22               [OK]
tobilg/mongodb-marathon  A Docker image to start a ...   4                [OK]
```


* "Stars" indicate the popularity of the image.

* "Official" images are those in the root namespace.

* "Automated" images are built automatically by the Docker Hub.
  <br/>(This means that their build recipe is always available.)

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Downloading images

There are two ways to download images.

* Explicitly, with `docker pull`.

* Implicitly, when executing `docker run` and the image is not found locally.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Pulling an image

```bash
$ docker pull debian:jessie
Pulling repository debian
b164861940b8: Download complete
b164861940b8: Pulling image (jessie) from debian
d1881793a057: Download complete
```

* As seen previously, images are made up of layers.

* Docker has downloaded all the necessary layers.

* In this example, `:jessie` indicates which exact version of Debian
  we would like.

  It is a *version tag*.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Image and tags

* Images can have tags.

* Tags define image versions or variants.

* `docker pull ubuntu` will refer to `ubuntu:latest`.

* The `:latest` tag is generally updated often.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## When to (not) use tags

Don't specify tags:

* When doing rapid testing and prototyping.
* When experimenting.
* When you want the latest version.

Do specify tags:

* When recording a procedure into a script.
* When going to production.
* To ensure that the same version will be used everywhere.
* To ensure repeatability later.

This is similar to what we would do with `pip install`, `npm install`, etc.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Section summary

We've learned how to:

* Understand images and layers.
* Understand Docker image namespacing.
* Search and download images.

# Building Docker images with a Dockerfile (Basic)

![Construction site with containers](images/title-building-docker-images-with-a-dockerfile.jpg)

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Objectives

We will build a container image automatically, with a `Dockerfile`.

At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Write a `Dockerfile`.

* Build an image from a `Dockerfile`.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## `Dockerfile` overview

* A `Dockerfile` is a build recipe for a Docker image.

* It contains a series of instructions telling Docker how an image is constructed.

* The `docker build` command builds an image from a `Dockerfile`.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Writing our first `Dockerfile`

Our Dockerfile must be in a **new, empty directory**.

1. Create a directory to hold our `Dockerfile`.

```bash
$ mkdir myimage
```

2. Create a `Dockerfile` inside this directory.

```bash
$ cd myimage
$ vim Dockerfile
```

Of course, you can use any other editor of your choice.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Type this into our Dockerfile...

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install figlet
```

* `FROM` indicates the base image for our build.

* Each `RUN` line will be executed by Docker during the build.

* Our `RUN` commands **must be non-interactive.**
  <br/>(No input can be provided to Docker during the build.)

* In many cases, we will add the `-y` flag to `apt-get`.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Build it!

Save our file, then execute:

```bash
$ docker build -t figlet .
```

* `-t` indicates the tag to apply to the image.

* `.` indicates the location of the *build context*.

We will talk more about the build context later.

To keep things simple for now: this is the directory where our Dockerfile is located.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## What happens when we build the image?

The output of `docker build` looks like this:

.small[
```bash
docker build -t figlet .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  2.048kB
Step 1/3 : FROM ubuntu
 ---> f975c5035748
Step 2/3 : RUN apt-get update
 ---> Running in e01b294dbffd
(...output of the RUN command...)
Removing intermediate container e01b294dbffd
 ---> eb8d9b561b37
Step 3/3 : RUN apt-get install figlet
 ---> Running in c29230d70f9b
(...output of the RUN command...)
Removing intermediate container c29230d70f9b
 ---> 0dfd7a253f21
Successfully built 0dfd7a253f21
Successfully tagged figlet:latest
```
]

* The output of the `RUN` commands has been omitted.
* Let's explain what this output means.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Sending the build context to Docker

```bash
Sending build context to Docker daemon 2.048 kB
```

* The build context is the `.` directory given to `docker build`.

* It is sent (as an archive) by the Docker client to the Docker daemon.

* This allows to use a remote machine to build using local files.

* Be careful (or patient) if that directory is big and your link is slow.

* You can speed up the process with a [`.dockerignore`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file) file 

  * It tells docker to ignore specific files in the directory

  * Only ignore files that you won't need in the build context!

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Executing each step

```bash
Step 2/3 : RUN apt-get update
 ---> Running in e01b294dbffd
(...output of the RUN command...)
Removing intermediate container e01b294dbffd
 ---> eb8d9b561b37
```

* A container (`e01b294dbffd`) is created from the base image.

* The `RUN` command is executed in this container.

* The container is committed into an image (`eb8d9b561b37`).

* The build container (`e01b294dbffd`) is removed.

* The output of this step will be the base image for the next one.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## The caching system

If you run the same build again, it will be instantaneous. Why?

* After each build step, Docker takes a snapshot of the resulting image.

* Before executing a step, Docker checks if it has already built the same sequence.

* Docker uses the exact strings defined in your Dockerfile, so:

  * `RUN apt-get install figlet cowsay ` 
    <br/> is different from
    <br/> `RUN apt-get install cowsay figlet`
  
  * `RUN apt-get update` is not re-executed when the mirrors are updated

You can force a rebuild with `docker build --no-cache ...`.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Running the image

The resulting image is not different from the one produced manually.

```bash
$ docker run -ti figlet
root@91f3c974c9a1:/# figlet hello
 _          _ _       
| |__   ___| | | ___  
| '_ \ / _ \ | |/ _ \ 
| | | |  __/ | | (_) |
|_| |_|\___|_|_|\___/ 
```


Yay! .emoji[🎉]

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Using image and viewing history

The `history` command lists all the layers composing an image.

For each layer, it shows its creation time, size, and creation command.

When an image was built with a Dockerfile, each layer corresponds to
a line of the Dockerfile.

```bash
$ docker history figlet
IMAGE         CREATED            CREATED BY                     SIZE
f9e8f1642759  About an hour ago  /bin/sh -c apt-get install fi  1.627 MB

<missing>     4 days ago         /bin/sh -c #(nop) ADD file:b   187.8 MB
```

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Why `sh -c`?

* On UNIX, to start a new program, we need two system calls:

  - `fork()`, to create a new child process;

  - `execve()`, to replace the new child process with the program to run.

* Conceptually, `execve()` works like this:

  `execve(program, [list, of, arguments])`

* When we run a command, e.g. `ls -l /tmp`, something needs to parse the command.

  (i.e. split the program and its arguments into a list.)

* The shell is usually doing that.

  (It also takes care of expanding environment variables and special things like `~`.)

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Why `sh -c`?

* When we do `RUN ls -l /tmp`, the Docker builder needs to parse the command.

* Instead of implementing its own parser, it outsources the job to the shell.

* That's why we see `sh -c ls -l /tmp` in that case.

* But we can also do the parsing jobs ourselves.

* This means passing `RUN` a list of arguments.

* This is called the *exec syntax*.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Shell syntax vs exec syntax

Dockerfile commands that execute something can have two forms:

* plain string, or *shell syntax*:
  <br/>`RUN apt-get install figlet`

* JSON list, or *exec syntax*:
  <br/>`RUN ["apt-get", "install", "figlet"]`

We are going to change our Dockerfile to see how it affects the resulting image.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Using exec syntax in our Dockerfile

Let's change our Dockerfile as follows!

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN ["apt-get", "install", "figlet"]
```

Then build the new Dockerfile.

```bash
$ docker build -t figlet .
```

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## History with exec syntax

Compare the new history:

```bash
$ docker history figlet
IMAGE         CREATED            CREATED BY                     SIZE
27954bb5faaf  10 seconds ago     apt-get install figlet         1.627 MB
7257c37726a1  About an hour ago  /bin/sh -c apt-get update      21.58 MB
07c86167cdc4  4 days ago         /bin/sh -c #(nop) CMD ["/bin   0 B
<missing>     4 days ago         /bin/sh -c sed -i 's/^#\s*\(   1.895 kB
<missing>     4 days ago         /bin/sh -c echo '#!/bin/sh'    194.5 kB
<missing>     4 days ago         /bin/sh -c #(nop) ADD file:b   187.8 MB
```

* Exec syntax specifies an *exact* command to execute.

* Shell syntax specifies a command to be wrapped within `/bin/sh -c "..."`.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## When to use exec syntax and shell syntax

* shell syntax:

  * is easier to write
  * interpolates environment variables and other shell expressions
  * creates an extra process (`/bin/sh -c ...`) to parse the string
  * requires `/bin/sh` to exist in the container

* exec syntax:

  * is harder to write (and read!)
  * passes all arguments without extra processing
  * doesn't create an extra process
  * doesn't require `/bin/sh` to exist in the container

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Pro-tip: the `exec` shell built-in

POSIX shells have a built-in command named `exec`.

`exec` should be followed by a program and its arguments.

From a user perspective:

- it looks like the shell exits right away after the command execution,

- in fact, the shell exits just *before* command execution;

- or rather, the shell gets *replaced* by the command.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Example using `exec`

```dockerfile
CMD exec figlet -f script hello
```

In this example, `sh -c` will still be used, but
`figlet` will be PID 1 in the container.

The shell gets replaced by `figlet` when `figlet` starts execution.

This allows to run processes as PID 1 without using JSON.

## `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT`

![Container entry doors](images/entrypoint.jpg)

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Objectives

In this lesson, we will learn about two important
Dockerfile commands:

`CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT`.

These commands allow us to set the default command
to run in a container.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Defining a default command

When people run our container, we want to greet them with a nice hello message, and using a custom font.

For that, we will execute:

```bash
figlet -f script hello
```

* `-f script` tells figlet to use a fancy font.

* `hello` is the message that we want it to display.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Adding `CMD` to our Dockerfile

Our new Dockerfile will look like this:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN ["apt-get", "install", "figlet"]
CMD figlet -f script hello
```

* `CMD` defines a default command to run when none is given.

* It can appear at any point in the file.

* Each `CMD` will replace and override the previous one.

* As a result, while you can have multiple `CMD` lines, it is useless.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Build and test our image

Let's build it:

```bash
$ docker build -t figlet .
...
Successfully built 042dff3b4a8d
Successfully tagged figlet:latest
```

And run it:

```bash
$ docker run figlet
 _          _   _       
| |        | | | |      
| |     _  | | | |  __  
|/ \   |/  |/  |/  /  \_
|   |_/|__/|__/|__/\__/ 
```

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Overriding `CMD`

If we want to get a shell into our container (instead of running
`figlet`), we just have to specify a different program to run:

```bash
$ docker run -it figlet bash
root@7ac86a641116:/# 
```

* We specified `bash`.

* It replaced the value of `CMD`.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Using `ENTRYPOINT`

We want to be able to specify a different message on the command line,
while retaining `figlet` and some default parameters.

In other words, we would like to be able to do this:

```bash
$ docker run figlet salut
           _            
          | |           
 ,   __,  | |       _|_ 
/ \_/  |  |/  |   |  |  
 \/ \_/|_/|__/ \_/|_/|_/
```


We will use the `ENTRYPOINT` verb in Dockerfile.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Adding `ENTRYPOINT` to our Dockerfile

Our new Dockerfile will look like this:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN ["apt-get", "install", "figlet"]
ENTRYPOINT ["figlet", "-f", "script"]
```

* `ENTRYPOINT` defines a base command (and its parameters) for the container.

* The command line arguments are appended to those parameters.

* Like `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT` can appear anywhere, and replaces the previous value.

Why did we use JSON syntax for our `ENTRYPOINT`?

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Implications of JSON vs string syntax

* When CMD or ENTRYPOINT use string syntax, they get wrapped in `sh -c`.

* To avoid this wrapping, we can use JSON syntax.

What if we used `ENTRYPOINT` with string syntax?

```bash
$ docker run figlet salut
```

This would run the following command in the `figlet` image:

```bash
sh -c "figlet -f script" salut
```

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Build and test our image

Let's build it:

```bash
$ docker build -t figlet .
...
Successfully built 36f588918d73
Successfully tagged figlet:latest
```

And run it:

```bash
$ docker run figlet salut
           _            
          | |           
 ,   __,  | |       _|_ 
/ \_/  |  |/  |   |  |  
 \/ \_/|_/|__/ \_/|_/|_/
```

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Using `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` together

What if we want to define a default message for our container?

Then we will use `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` together.

* `ENTRYPOINT` will define the base command for our container.

* `CMD` will define the default parameter(s) for this command.

* They *both* have to use JSON syntax.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` together

Our new Dockerfile will look like this:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN ["apt-get", "install", "figlet"]
ENTRYPOINT ["figlet", "-f", "script"]
CMD ["hello world"]
```

* `ENTRYPOINT` defines a base command (and its parameters) for the container.

* If we don't specify extra command-line arguments when starting the container,
  the value of `CMD` is appended.

* Otherwise, our extra command-line arguments are used instead of `CMD`.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Build and test our image

Let's build it:

```bash
$ docker build -t myfiglet .
...
Successfully built 6e0b6a048a07
Successfully tagged myfiglet:latest
```

Run it without parameters:

```bash
$ docker run myfiglet
 _          _   _                             _        
| |        | | | |                           | |    |  
| |     _  | | | |  __             __   ,_   | |  __|  
|/ \   |/  |/  |/  /  \_  |  |  |_/  \_/  |  |/  /  |  
|   |_/|__/|__/|__/\__/    \/ \/  \__/    |_/|__/\_/|_/
```

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Overriding the image default parameters

Now let's pass extra arguments to the image.

```bash
$ docker run myfiglet hola mundo
 _           _                                               
| |         | |                                      |       
| |     __  | |  __,     _  _  _           _  _    __|   __  
|/ \   /  \_|/  /  |    / |/ |/ |  |   |  / |/ |  /  |  /  \_
|   |_/\__/ |__/\_/|_/    |  |  |_/ \_/|_/  |  |_/\_/|_/\__/ 
```

We overrode `CMD` but still used `ENTRYPOINT`.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Overriding `ENTRYPOINT`

What if we want to run a shell in our container?

We cannot just do `docker run myfiglet bash` because
that would just tell figlet to display the word "bash."

We use the `--entrypoint` parameter:

```bash
$ docker run -it --entrypoint bash myfiglet
root@6027e44e2955:/# 
```

## Copying files during the build

![Monks copying books](images/title-copying-files-during-build.jpg)

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Objectives

So far, we have installed things in our container images
by downloading packages.

We can also copy files from the *build context* to the
container that we are building.

Remember: the *build context* is the directory containing
the Dockerfile.

In this chapter, we will learn a new Dockerfile keyword: `COPY`.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Build some C code

We want to build a container that compiles a basic "Hello world" program in C.

Here is the program, `hello.c`:

```bash
int main () {
  puts("Hello, world!");
  return 0;
}
```

Let's create a new directory, and put this file in there.

Then we will write the Dockerfile.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## The Dockerfile

On Debian and Ubuntu, the package `build-essential` will get us a compiler.

When installing it, don't forget to specify the `-y` flag, otherwise the build will fail (since the build cannot be interactive).

Then we will use `COPY` to place the source file into the container.

```bash
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y build-essential
COPY hello.c /
RUN make hello
CMD /hello
```

Create this Dockerfile.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Testing our C program

* Create `hello.c` and `Dockerfile` in the same directory.

* Run `docker build -t hello .` in this directory.

* Run `docker run hello`, you should see `Hello, world!`.

Success!

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## `COPY` and the build cache

* Run the build again.

* Now, modify `hello.c` and run the build again.

* Docker can cache steps involving `COPY`.

* Those steps will not be executed again if the files haven't been changed.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Details

* You can `COPY` whole directories recursively.

* Older Dockerfiles also have the `ADD` instruction.
  <br/>It is similar but can automatically extract archives.

* If we really wanted to compile C code in a container, we would:

  * Place it in a different directory, with the `WORKDIR` instruction.

  * Even better, use the `gcc` official image.

# Building Docker images with a Dockerfile (Advanced)

We will see how to:

* Reduce the number of layers.

* Leverage the build cache so that builds can be faster.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Reducing the number of layers

* Each line in a `Dockerfile` creates a new layer.

* Build your `Dockerfile` to take advantage of Docker's caching system.

* Combine commands by using `&&` to continue commands and `\` to wrap lines.

Note: it is frequent to build a Dockerfile line by line:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get install thisthing
RUN apt-get install andthatthing andthatotherone
RUN apt-get install somemorestuff
```

And then refactor it trivially before shipping:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get install thisthing andthatthing andthatotherone somemorestuff
```

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Avoid re-installing dependencies at each build

* Classic Dockerfile problem:

  "each time I change a line of code, all my dependencies are re-installed!"

* Solution: `COPY` dependency lists (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`, etc.)
  by themselves to avoid reinstalling unchanged dependencies every time.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Example "bad" `Dockerfile`

The dependencies are reinstalled every time, because the build system does not know if `requirements.txt` has been updated.

```bash
FROM python
WORKDIR /src
COPY . .
RUN pip install -qr requirements.txt
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Fixed `Dockerfile`

Adding the dependencies as a separate step means that Docker can cache more efficiently and only install them when `requirements.txt` changes.

```bash
FROM python
COPY requirements.txt /tmp/requirements.txt
RUN pip install -qr /tmp/requirements.txt
WORKDIR /src
COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Be careful with `chown`, `chmod`, `mv`

* Layers cannot store efficiently changes in permissions or ownership.

* Layers cannot represent efficiently when a file is moved either.

* As a result, operations like `chown`, `chown`, `mv` can be expensive.

* For instance, in the Dockerfile snippet below, each `RUN` line
  creates a layer with an entire copy of `some-file`.

  ```dockerfile
  COPY some-file .
  RUN chown www-data:www-data some-file
  RUN chmod 644 some-file
  RUN mv some-file /var/www
  ```

* How can we avoid that?

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Put files on the right place

* Instead of using `mv`, directly put files at the right place.

* When extracting archives (tar, zip...), merge operations in a single layer.

  Example:

  ```dockerfile
    ...
    RUN wget http://.../foo.tar.gz \
     && tar -zxf foo.tar.gz \
     && mv foo/fooctl /usr/local/bin \
     && rm -rf foo
  ...
  ```

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Use `COPY --chown`

* The Dockerfile instruction `COPY` can take a `--chown` parameter.

  Examples:

  ```dockerfile
  ...
  COPY --chown=1000 some-file .
  COPY --chown=1000:1000 some-file .
  COPY --chown=www-data:www-data some-file .
  ```

* The `--chown` flag can specify a user, or a user:group pair.

* The user and group can be specified as names or numbers.

* When using names, the names must exist in `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/group`.

  *(In the container, not on the host!)*

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Set correct permissions locally

* Instead of using `chmod`, set the right file permissions locally.

* When files are copied with `COPY`, permissions are preserved.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Embedding unit tests in the build process

```dockerfile
FROM <baseimage>
RUN <install dependencies>
COPY <code>
RUN <build code>
RUN <install test dependencies>
COPY <test data sets and fixtures>
RUN <unit tests>
FROM <baseimage>
RUN <install dependencies>
COPY <code>
RUN <build code>
CMD, EXPOSE ...
```

* The build fails as soon as an instruction fails
* If `RUN <unit tests>` fails, the build doesn't produce an image
* If it succeeds, it produces a clean image (without test libraries and data)

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Dockerfile examples

There are a number of tips, tricks, and techniques that we can use in Dockerfiles.

But sometimes, we have to use different (and even opposed) practices depending on:

- the complexity of our project,

- the programming language or framework that we are using,

- the stage of our project (early MVP vs. super-stable production),

- whether we're building a final image or a base for further images,

- etc.

We are going to show a few examples using very different techniques.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## When to optimize an image

When authoring official images, it is a good idea to reduce as much as possible:

- the number of layers,

- the size of the final image.

This is often done at the expense of build time and convenience for the image maintainer;
but when an image is downloaded millions of time, saving even a few seconds of pull time
can be worth it.

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y libpng12-dev libjpeg-dev && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
	&& docker-php-ext-configure gd --with-png-dir=/usr --with-jpeg-dir=/usr \
	&& docker-php-ext-install gd
...
RUN curl -o wordpress.tar.gz -SL https://wordpress.org/wordpress-${WORDPRESS_UPSTREAM_VERSION}.tar.gz \
	&& echo "$WORDPRESS_SHA1 *wordpress.tar.gz" | sha1sum -c - \
	&& tar -xzf wordpress.tar.gz -C /usr/src/ \
	&& rm wordpress.tar.gz \
	&& chown -R www-data:www-data /usr/src/wordpress
```
]

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## When to *not* optimize an image

Sometimes, it is better to prioritize *maintainer convenience*.

In particular, if:

- the image changes a lot,

- the image has very few users (e.g. only 1, the maintainer!),

- the image is built and run on the same machine,

- the image is built and run on machines with a very fast link ...

In these cases, just keep things simple!

---

## Entrypoints and wrappers

It is very common to define a custom entrypoint.

That entrypoint will generally be a script, performing any combination of:

- pre-flights checks (if a required dependency is not available, display
  a nice error message early instead of an obscure one in a deep log file),

- generation or validation of configuration files,

- dropping privileges (with e.g. `su` or `gosu`, sometimes combined with `chown`),

- and more.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Production image

This Dockerfile builds an image leveraging gunicorn:

```dockerfile
FROM python
RUN pip install flask
RUN pip install gunicorn
RUN pip install redis
COPY . /src
WORKDIR /src
CMD gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 --workers 10 counter:app
EXPOSE 5000
```
.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Reducing image size

* Final image should contain:

  * our program

  * its source code

  * the compiler

* Only the first one is strictly necessary.

* We are going to see how to obtain an image without the superfluous components.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Can't we remove superfluous files with `RUN`?

What happens if we do one of the following commands?

- `RUN rm -rf ...`

- `RUN apt-get remove ...`

- `RUN make clean ...`

--

This adds a layer which removes a bunch of files.

But the previous layers (which added the files) still exist.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Removing files with an extra layer

When downloading an image, all the layers must be downloaded.

| Dockerfile instruction | Layer size | Image size |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| `FROM ubuntu` | Size of base image | Size of base image |
| `...` | ... | Sum of this layer <br/>+ all previous ones |
| `RUN apt-get install somepackage` | Size of files added <br/>(e.g. a few MB) | Sum of this layer <br/>+ all previous ones |
| `...` | ... | Sum of this layer <br/>+ all previous ones |
| `RUN apt-get remove somepackage` | Almost zero <br/>(just metadata) | Same as previous one |

Therefore, `RUN rm` does not reduce the size of the image or free up disk space.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Removing unnecessary files

Various techniques are available to obtain smaller images:

- collapsing layers,

- adding binaries that are built outside of the Dockerfile,

- squashing the final image,

- multi-stage builds.

Let's review them quickly.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Collapsing layers

You will frequently see Dockerfiles like this:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install xxx && ... && apt-get remove xxx && ...
```

Or the (more readable) variant:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update \
 && apt-get install xxx \
 && ... \
 && apt-get remove xxx \
 && ...
```

This `RUN` command gives us a single layer.

The files that are added, then removed in the same layer, do not grow the layer size.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Building binaries outside of the Dockerfile

This results in a Dockerfile looking like this:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
COPY xxx /usr/local/bin
```

Of course, this implies that the file `xxx` exists in the build context.

That file has to exist before you can run `docker build`.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Building binaries outside: pros and cons

Pros:

- final image can be very small

Cons:

- requires an extra build tool

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Multi-stage builds

Multi-stage builds allow us to have multiple *stages*.

Each stage is a separate image, and can copy files from previous stages.

We're going to see how they work in more detail.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Multi-stage builds

* At any point in our `Dockerfile`, we can add a new `FROM` line.

* This line starts a new stage of our build.

* Each stage can access the files of the previous stages with `COPY --from=...`.

* When a build is tagged (with `docker build -t ...`), the last stage is tagged.

* Previous stages are not discarded: they will be used for caching, and can be referenced.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Multi-stage builds in practice

* Each stage is numbered, starting at `0`

* We can copy a file from a previous stage by indicating its number, e.g.:

  ```dockerfile
  COPY --from=0 /file/from/first/stage /location/in/current/stage
  ```

* We can also name stages, and reference these names:

  ```dockerfile
  FROM golang AS builder
  RUN ...
  FROM alpine
  COPY --from=builder /go/bin/mylittlebinary /usr/local/bin/
  ```

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Multi-stage builds for our C program

We will change our Dockerfile to:

* give a nickname to the first stage: `compiler`

* add a second stage using the same `ubuntu` base image

* add the `hello` binary to the second stage

* make sure that `CMD` is in the second stage 

The resulting Dockerfile is on the next slide.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Multi-stage build `Dockerfile`

Here is the final Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu AS compiler
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y build-essential
COPY hello.c /
RUN make hello
FROM ubuntu
COPY --from=compiler /hello /hello
CMD /hello
```

Let's build it, and check that it works correctly:

```bash
docker build -t hellomultistage .
docker run hellomultistage
```

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Comparing single/multi-stage build image sizes

List our images with `docker images`, and check the size of:

- the `ubuntu` base image,

- the single-stage `hello` image,

- the multi-stage `hellomultistage` image.

We can achieve even smaller images if we use smaller base images.

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Publishing images to the Docker Hub

We have built our first images.

We can now publish it to the Docker Hub!

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Logging into our Docker Hub account

* This can be done from the Docker CLI:
  ```bash
  docker login
  ```

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Image tags and registry addresses

* Docker images tags are like Git tags and branches.

* They are like *bookmarks* pointing at a specific image ID.

* Tagging an image doesn't *rename* an image: it adds another tag.

* When pushing an image to a registry, the registry address is in the tag.

  Example: `registry.example.net:5000/image`

* What about Docker Hub images?

--

* `ahmedgabercod/clock` is, in fact, `index.docker.io/ahmedgabercod/clock`

* `ubuntu` is, in fact, `library/ubuntu`, i.e. `index.docker.io/library/ubuntu`

.debug[[containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Build_with_Dockerfile.md)]
---

## Tagging an image to push it on the Hub

* Let's tag our `figlet` image (or any other to our liking):
  ```bash
  docker tag figlet ahmedgabercod/figlet
  ```

* And push it to the Hub:
  ```bash
  docker push ahmedgabercod/figlet
  ```

* That's it!

# Introspection

![Markings on container door](images/title-naming-and-inspecting-containers.jpg)

.debug[[containers/Introspection.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Introspection.md)]
---

## Objectives

In this lesson, we will learn about an important
Docker concept: container *naming*.

Naming allows us to:

* Reference easily a container.

* Ensure unicity of a specific container.

We will also see the `inspect` command, which gives a lot of details about a container.

.debug[[containers/Introspection.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Introspection.md)]
---

## Naming our containers

So far, we have referenced containers with their ID.

We have copy-pasted the ID, or used a shortened prefix.

But each container can also be referenced by its name.

If a container is named `thumbnail-worker`, I can do:

```bash
$ docker logs thumbnail-worker
$ docker stop thumbnail-worker
etc.
```

.debug[[containers/Introspection.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Introspection.md)]
---

## Default names

When we create a container, if we don't give a specific
name, Docker will pick one for us.

It will be the concatenation of:

* A mood (furious, goofy, suspicious, boring...)

* The name of a famous inventor (tesla, darwin, wozniak...)

Examples: `happy_curie`, `clever_hopper`, `jovial_lovelace` ...

.debug[[containers/Introspection.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Introspection.md)]
---

## Specifying a name

You can set the name of the container when you create it.

```bash
$ docker run --name ticktock ahmedgabercod/clock
```

If you specify a name that already exists, Docker will refuse
to create the container.

This lets us enforce unicity of a given resource.

.debug[[containers/Introspection.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Introspection.md)]
---

## Renaming containers

* You can rename containers with `docker rename`.

* This allows you to "free up" a name without destroying the associated container.

.debug[[containers/Introspection.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Introspection.md)]
---

## Inspecting a container

The `docker inspect` command will output a very detailed JSON map.

```bash
$ docker inspect <containerID>
[{
...
(many pages of JSON here)
...
```

There are multiple ways to consume that information.

.debug[[containers/Introspection.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Introspection.md)]
---

## Parsing JSON with the Shell

* You *could* grep and cut or awk the output of `docker inspect`.

* Please, don't.

* It's painful.

* If you really must parse JSON from the Shell, use JQ! (It's great.)

```bash
$ docker inspect <containerID> | jq .
```

* We will see a better solution which doesn't require extra tools.

.debug[[containers/Introspection.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Introspection.md)]
---

## Using `--format`

You can specify a format string, which will be parsed by 
Go's text/template package.

```bash
$ docker inspect --format '{{ json .Created }}' <containerID>
"2015-02-24T07:21:11.712240394Z"
```

* The generic syntax is to wrap the expression with double curly braces.

* The expression starts with a dot representing the JSON object.

* Then each field or member can be accessed in dotted notation syntax.

* The optional `json` keyword asks for valid JSON output.
  <br/>(e.g. here it adds the surrounding double-quotes.)

* Get the PID of the container running on the host

# Networking and Volumes

![A dense graph network](images/title-container-networking-basics.jpg)

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Objectives

We will now run network services (accepting requests) in containers.

At the end of this section, you will be able to:

* Run a network service in a container.

* Manipulate container networking basics.

* Find a container's IP address.

We will also explain the different network models used by Docker.

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## A simple, static web server

Run the Docker Hub image `nginx`, which contains a basic web server:

```bash
$ docker run -d -P nginx
66b1ce719198711292c8f34f84a7b68c3876cf9f67015e752b94e189d35a204e
```

* Docker will download the image from the Docker Hub.

* `-d` tells Docker to run the image in the background.

* `-P` tells Docker to make this service reachable from other computers.
  <br/>(`-P` is the short version of `--publish-all`.)

But, how do we connect to our web server now?

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Finding our web server port

We will use `docker ps`:

```bash
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE  ...  PORTS                  ...
e40ffb406c9e  nginx  ...  0.0.0.0:32768->80/tcp  ...
```


* The web server is running on port 80 inside the container.

* This port is mapped to port 32768 on our Docker host.

We will explain the whys and hows of this port mapping.

But first, let's make sure that everything works properly.

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Connecting to our web server (GUI)

Point your browser to the IP address of your Docker host, on the port
shown by `docker ps` for container port 80.

![Screenshot](images/welcome-to-nginx.png)

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Connecting to our web server (CLI)

You can also use `curl` directly from the Docker host.

Make sure to use the right port number if it is different
from the example below:

```bash
$ curl localhost:32768
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
...
```

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## How does Docker know which port to map?

* There is metadata in the image telling "this image has something on port 80".

* We can see that metadata with `docker inspect`:

```bash
$ docker inspect --format '{{.Config.ExposedPorts}}' nginx
map[80/tcp:{}]
```

* This metadata was set in the Dockerfile, with the `EXPOSE` keyword.

* We can see that with `docker history`:

```bash
$ docker history nginx
IMAGE               CREATED             CREATED BY
7f70b30f2cc6        11 days ago         /bin/sh -c #(nop)  CMD ["nginx" "-g" "…
<missing>           11 days ago         /bin/sh -c #(nop)  STOPSIGNAL [SIGTERM]
<missing>           11 days ago         /bin/sh -c #(nop)  EXPOSE 80/tcp
```

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Why are we mapping ports?

* We are out of IPv4 addresses.

* Containers cannot have public IPv4 addresses.

* They have private addresses.

* Services have to be exposed port by port.

* Ports have to be mapped to avoid conflicts.

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Finding the web server port in a script

Parsing the output of `docker ps` would be painful.

There is a command to help us:

```bash
$ docker port <containerID> 80
32768
```

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Manual allocation of port numbers

If you want to set port numbers yourself, no problem:

```bash
$ docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx
$ docker run -d -p 8000:80 nginx
$ docker run -d -p 8080:80 -p 8888:80 nginx
```

* We are running three NGINX web servers.
* The first one is exposed on port 80.
* The second one is exposed on port 8000.
* The third one is exposed on ports 8080 and 8888.

Note: the convention is `port-on-host:port-on-container`.

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Finding the container's IP address

We can use the `docker inspect` command to find the IP address of the
container.

```bash
$ docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' <yourContainerID>
172.17.0.3
```

* `docker inspect` is an advanced command, that can retrieve a ton
  of information about our containers.

* Here, we provide it with a format string to extract exactly the
  private IP address of the container.

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Pinging our container

We can test connectivity to the container using the IP address we've
just discovered. Let's see this now by using the `ping` tool.

```bash
$ ping <ipAddress>
64 bytes from <ipAddress>: icmp_req=1 ttl=64 time=0.085 ms
64 bytes from <ipAddress>: icmp_req=2 ttl=64 time=0.085 ms
64 bytes from <ipAddress>: icmp_req=3 ttl=64 time=0.085 ms
```

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Section summary

We've learned how to:

* Expose a network port.

* Manipulate container networking basics.

* Find a container's IP address.

In the next chapter, we will see how to connect
containers together without exposing their ports.

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Container network drivers

The Docker Engine supports many different network drivers.

The built-in drivers include:

* `bridge` (default)

* `none`

* `host`

* `container`

The driver is selected with `docker run --net ...`.

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## The default bridge

* By default, the container gets a virtual `eth0` interface.
  <br/>(In addition to its own private `lo` loopback interface.)

* That interface is provided by a `veth` pair.

* It is connected to the Docker bridge.
  <br/>(Named `docker0` by default; configurable with `--bridge`.)

* Addresses are allocated on a private, internal subnet.
  <br/>(Docker uses 172.17.0.0/16 by default; configurable with `--bip`.)

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## The null driver

* Container is started with `docker run --net none ...`

* It only gets the `lo` loopback interface. No `eth0`.

* It can't send or receive network traffic.

* Useful for isolated/untrusted workloads.

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## The host driver

* Container is started with `docker run --net host ...`

* It sees (and can access) the network interfaces of the host.

* It can bind any address, any port (for ill and for good).

* Network traffic doesn't have to go through NAT, bridge, or veth.

* Performance = native!

Use cases:

* Performance sensitive applications (VOIP, gaming, streaming...)

* Peer discovery (e.g. Erlang port mapper, Raft, Serf...)

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## The container driver

* Container is started with `docker run --net container:id ...`

* It re-uses the network stack of another container.

* It shares with this other container the same interfaces, IP address(es), routes, iptables rules, etc.

* Those containers can communicate over their `lo` interface.
  <br/>(i.e. one can bind to 127.0.0.1 and the others can connect to it.)

## Creating a network

Let's create a network called `dev`.

```bash
$ docker network create dev
4c1ff84d6d3f1733d3e233ee039cac276f425a9d5228a4355d54878293a889ba
```

The network is now visible with the `network ls` command:

```bash
$ docker network ls
NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER
6bde79dfcf70        bridge              bridge
8d9c78725538        none                null
eb0eeab782f4        host                host
4c1ff84d6d3f        dev                 bridge
```

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Placing containers on a network

We will create a *named* container on this network.

It will be reachable with its name, `es`.

```bash
$ docker run -d --name es --net dev elasticsearch:2
8abb80e229ce8926c7223beb69699f5f34d6f1d438bfc5682db893e798046863
```

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Communication between containers

Now, create another container on this network.

.small[
```bash
$ docker run -ti --net dev alpine sh
root@0ecccdfa45ef:/#
```
]

From this new container, we can resolve and ping the other one, using its assigned name:

.small[
```bash
/ # ping es
PING es (172.18.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from es.dev (172.18.0.2): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.221 ms
64 bytes from es.dev (172.18.0.2): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.114 ms
64 bytes from es.dev (172.18.0.2): icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.114 ms
^C

root@0ecccdfa45ef:/#
```
]

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Resolving container addresses

In Docker Engine 1.9, name resolution is implemented with `/etc/hosts`, and
updating it each time containers are added/removed.

.small[
```bash
[root@0ecccdfa45ef /]# cat /etc/hosts
172.18.0.3  0ecccdfa45ef
127.0.0.1       localhost
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
172.18.0.2      es
172.18.0.2      es.dev
```
]

In Docker Engine 1.10, this has been replaced by a dynamic resolver.

(This avoids race conditions when updating `/etc/hosts`.)

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Service discovery with containers

* Let's try to run an application that requires two containers.

* The first container is a web server.

* The other one is a redis data store.

* We will place them both on the `dev` network created before.

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Running the web server

* The application is provided by the container image `ahmedgabercod/trainingwheels`.

* We don't know much about it so we will try to run it and see what happens!

Start the container, exposing all its ports:

```bash
$ docker run --net dev -d -P ahmedgabercod/trainingwheels
```

Check the port that has been allocated to it:

```bash
$ docker ps -l
```

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Test the web server

* If we connect to the application now, we will see an error page:

![Trainingwheels error](images/trainingwheels-error.png)

* This is because the Redis service is not running.
* This container tries to resolve the name `redis`.

Note: we're not using a FQDN or an IP address here; just `redis`.

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Start the data store

* We need to start a Redis container.

* That container must be on the same network as the web server.

* It must have the right name (`redis`) so the application can find it.

Start the container:

```bash
$ docker run --net dev --name redis -d redis
```

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Test the web server again

* If we connect to the application now, we should see that the app is working correctly:

![Trainingwheels OK](images/trainingwheels-ok.png)

* When the app tries to resolve `redis`, instead of getting a DNS error, it gets the IP address of our Redis container.

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

class: extra-details 

## A few words on *scope*

* What if we want to run multiple copies of our application?

* Since names are unique, there can be only one container named `redis` at a time.

* However, we can specify the network name of our container with `--net-alias`.

* `--net-alias` is scoped per network, and independent from the container name.

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Using a network alias instead of a name

Let's remove the `redis` container:

```bash
$ docker rm -f redis
```

* `-f`: Force the removal of a running container (uses SIGKILL)

And create one that doesn't block the `redis` name:

```bash
$ docker run --net dev --net-alias redis -d redis
```

Check that the app still works (but the counter is back to 1,
since we wiped out the old Redis container).

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Names are *local* to each network

Let's try to ping our `es` container from another container, when that other container is *not* on the `dev` network.

```bash
$ docker run --rm alpine ping es
ping: bad address 'es'
```

Names can be resolved only when containers are on the same network.

Containers can contact each other only when they are on the same network (you can try to ping using the IP address to verify).

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Network aliases

We would like to have another network, `prod`, with its own `es` container. But there can be only one container named `es`!

We will use *network aliases*.

A container can have multiple network aliases.

Network aliases are *local* to a given network (only exist in this network).

Multiple containers can have the same network alias (even on the same network). In Docker Engine 1.11, resolving a network alias yields the IP addresses of all containers holding this alias.

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Creating containers on another network

Create the `prod` network.

```bash
$ docker network create prod
5a41562fecf2d8f115bedc16865f7336232a04268bdf2bd816aecca01b68d50c
```

We can now create multiple containers with the `es` alias on the new `prod` network.

```bash
$ docker run -d --name prod-es-1 --net-alias es --net prod elasticsearch:2
38079d21caf0c5533a391700d9e9e920724e89200083df73211081c8a356d771
$ docker run -d --name prod-es-2 --net-alias es --net prod elasticsearch:2
1820087a9c600f43159688050dcc164c298183e1d2e62d5694fd46b10ac3bc3d
```

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Resolving network aliases

Let's try DNS resolution first, using the `nslookup` tool that ships with the `alpine` image.

```bash
$ docker run --net prod --rm alpine nslookup es
Name:      es
Address 1: 172.23.0.3 prod-es-2.prod
Address 2: 172.23.0.2 prod-es-1.prod
```

(You can ignore the `can't resolve '(null)'` errors.)

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Connecting to aliased containers

Each ElasticSearch instance has a name (generated when it is started). This name can be seen when we issue a simple HTTP request on the ElasticSearch API endpoint.

Try the following command a few times:

.small[
```bash
$ docker run --rm --net dev centos curl -s es:9200
{
  "name" : "Tarot",
...
}
```
]

Then try it a few times by replacing `--net dev` with `--net prod`:

.small[
```bash
$ docker run --rm --net prod centos curl -s es:9200
{
  "name" : "The Symbiote",
...
}
```
]

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

class: extra-details


## Good to know ...

* Docker will not create network names and aliases on the default `bridge` network.

* Therefore, if you want to use those features, you have to create a custom network first.

* Network aliases are *not* unique on a given network.

* i.e., multiple containers can have the same alias on the same network.

* In that scenario, the Docker DNS server will return multiple records.
  <br/>
  (i.e. you will get DNS round robin out of the box.)

* Enabling *Swarm Mode* gives access to clustering and load balancing with IPVS.

* Creation of networks and network aliases is generally automated with tools like Compose.

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## A few words about round robin DNS

Don't rely exclusively on round robin DNS to achieve load balancing.

Many factors can affect DNS resolution, and you might see:

- all traffic going to a single instance;
- traffic being split (unevenly) between some instances;
- different behavior depending on your application language;
- different behavior depending on your base distro;
- different behavior depending on other factors (sic).

It's OK to use DNS to discover available endpoints, but remember that you have to re-resolve every now and then to discover new endpoints.

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Custom networks

When creating a network, extra options can be provided.

* `--internal` disables outbound traffic (the network won't have a default gateway).

* `--gateway` indicates which address to use for the gateway (when outbound traffic is allowed).

* `--subnet` (in CIDR notation) indicates the subnet to use.

* `--ip-range` (in CIDR notation) indicates the subnet to allocate from.

* `--aux-address` allows specifying a list of reserved addresses (which won't be allocated to containers).

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Setting containers' IP address

* It is possible to set a container's address with `--ip`.
* The IP address has to be within the subnet used for the container.

A full example would look like this.

```bash
$ docker network create --subnet 10.66.0.0/16 pubnet
42fb16ec412383db6289a3e39c3c0224f395d7f85bcb1859b279e7a564d4e135
$ docker run --net pubnet --ip 10.66.66.66 -d nginx

## Overlay networks

* The features we've seen so far only work when all containers are on a single host.

* If containers span multiple hosts, we need an *overlay* network to connect them together.

* Docker ships with a default network plugin, `overlay`, implementing an overlay network leveraging
  VXLAN, *enabled with Swarm Mode*.

* Other plugins (Weave, Calico...) can provide overlay networks as well.

* Once you have an overlay network, *all the features that we've used in this chapter work identically
  across multiple hosts.*

## Multi-host networking (overlay)

Out of the scope for this intro-level workshop!

Very short instructions:

- enable Swarm Mode (`docker swarm init` then `docker swarm join` on other nodes)
- `docker network create mynet --driver overlay`
- `docker service create --network mynet myimage`

If you want to learn more about Swarm mode, you can check
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuzoEaE6Cqs)
or [these slides](https://container.training/swarm-selfpaced.yml.html).

## Multi-host networking (plugins)

Out of the scope for this intro-level workshop!

General idea:

- install the plugin (they often ship within containers)

- run the plugin (if it's in a container, it will often require extra parameters; don't just `docker run` it blindly!)

- some plugins require configuration or activation (creating a special file that tells Docker "use the plugin whose control socket is at the following location")

- you can then `docker network create --driver pluginname`

## Connecting and disconnecting dynamically

* So far, we have specified which network to use when starting the container.

* The Docker Engine also allows connecting and disconnecting while the container is running.

* This feature is exposed through the Docker API, and through two Docker CLI commands:

  * `docker network connect <network> <container>`

  * `docker network disconnect <network> <container>`

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Dynamically connecting to a network

* We have a container named `es` connected to a network named `dev`.

* Let's start a simple alpine container on the default network:

  ```bash
  $ docker run -ti alpine sh
  / #
  ```

* In this container, try to ping the `es` container:

  ```bash
  / # ping es
  ping: bad address 'es'
  ```

  This doesn't work, but we will change that by connecting the container.

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Finding the container ID and connecting it

* Figure out the ID of our alpine container; here are two methods:

  * looking at `/etc/hostname` in the container,

  * running `docker ps -lq` on the host.

* Run the following command on the host:

  ```bash
  $ docker network connect dev `<container_id>`
  ```

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Checking what we did

* Try again to `ping es` from the container.

* It should now work correctly:

  ```bash
  / # ping es
  PING es (172.20.0.3): 56 data bytes
  64 bytes from 172.20.0.3: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.376 ms
  64 bytes from 172.20.0.3: seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.130 ms
  ^C
  ```

* Interrupt it with Ctrl-C.

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Looking at the network setup in the container

We can look at the list of network interfaces with `ifconfig`, `ip a`, or `ip l`:

.small[
```bash
/ # ip a
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
18: eth0@if19: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP,M-DOWN> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP
    link/ether 02:42:ac:11:00:02 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.17.0.2/16 brd 172.17.255.255 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
20: eth1@if21: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP,M-DOWN> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP
    link/ether 02:42:ac:14:00:04 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.20.0.4/16 brd 172.20.255.255 scope global eth1
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
/ #
```
]

Each network connection is materialized with a virtual network interface.

As we can see, we can be connected to multiple networks at the same time.

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Disconnecting from a network

* Let's try the symmetrical command to disconnect the container:
  ```bash
  $ docker network disconnect dev <container_id>
  ```

* From now on, if we try to ping `es`, it will not resolve:
  ```bash
  / # ping es
  ping: bad address 'es'
  ```

* Trying to ping the IP address directly won't work either:
  ```bash
  / # ping 172.20.0.3
  ... (nothing happens until we interrupt it with Ctrl-C)
  ```

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Network aliases are scoped per network

* Each network has its own set of network aliases.

* We saw this earlier: `es` resolves to different addresses in `dev` and `prod`.

* If we are connected to multiple networks, the resolver looks up names in each of them
  (as of Docker Engine 18.03, it is the connection order) and stops as soon as the name
  is found.

* Therefore, if we are connected to both `dev` and `prod`, resolving `es` will **not**
  give us the addresses of all the `es` services; but only the ones in `dev` or `prod`.

* However, we can lookup `es.dev` or `es.prod` if we need to.

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Finding out about our networks and names

* We can do reverse DNS lookups on containers' IP addresses.

* If the IP address belongs to a network (other than the default bridge), the result will be:

  ```
  name-or-first-alias-or-container-id.network-name
  ```

* Example:

.small[
```bash
$ docker run -ti --net prod --net-alias hello alpine
/ # apk add --no-cache drill
...
OK: 5 MiB in 13 packages
/ # ifconfig
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 02:42:AC:15:00:03
          inet addr:`172.21.0.3`  Bcast:172.21.255.255  Mask:255.255.0.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
...
/ # drill -t ptr `3.0.21.172`.in-addr.arpa
...
;; ANSWER SECTION:

## Building with a custom network

* We can build a Dockerfile with a custom network with `docker build --network NAME`.

* This can be used to check that a build doesn't access the network.

  (But keep in mind that most Dockerfiles will fail,
  <br/>because they need to install remote packages and dependencies!)

* This may be used to access an internal package repository.

  (But try to use a multi-stage build instead, if possible!)

## Working with volumes

![volume](images/title-working-with-volumes.jpg)

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Objectives

At the end of this section, you will be able to:

* Create containers holding volumes.

* Share volumes across containers.

* Share a host directory with one or many containers.

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Working with volumes

Docker volumes can be used to achieve many things, including:

* Sharing a directory between multiple containers.

* Sharing a directory between the host and a container.

* Sharing a *single file* between the host and a container.

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Volumes are special directories in a container

Volumes can be declared in two different ways:

* Within a `Dockerfile`, with a `VOLUME` instruction.

```dockerfile
VOLUME /uploads
```

* On the command-line, with the `-v` flag for `docker run`.

```bash
$ docker run -d -v /uploads myapp
```

In both cases, `/uploads` (inside the container) will be a volume.

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Volumes bypass the copy-on-write system

Volumes act as passthroughs to the host filesystem.

* The I/O performance on a volume is exactly the same as I/O performance
  on the Docker host.

* When you `docker commit`, the content of volumes is not brought into
  the resulting image.

* If a `RUN` instruction in a `Dockerfile` changes the content of a
  volume, those changes are not recorded neither.

* If a container is started with the `--read-only` flag, the volume
  will still be writable (unless the volume is a read-only volume).

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Volumes can be shared across containers

You can start a container with *exactly the same volumes* as another one.

The new container will have the same volumes, in the same directories.

They will contain exactly the same thing, and remain in sync.

Under the hood, they are actually the same directories on the host anyway.

This is done using the `--volumes-from` flag for `docker run`.

We will see an example in the following slides.

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Sharing app server logs with another container

Let's start a Tomcat container:

```bash
$ docker run --name webapp -d -p 8080:8080 -v /usr/local/tomcat/logs tomcat
```

Now, start an `alpine` container accessing the same volume:

```bash
$ docker run --volumes-from webapp alpine sh -c "tail -f /usr/local/tomcat/logs/*"
```

Then, from another window, send requests to our Tomcat container:
```bash
$ curl localhost:8080
```

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Volumes exist independently of containers

If a container is stopped or removed, its volumes still exist and are available.

Volumes can be listed and manipulated with `docker volume` subcommands:

```bash
$ docker volume ls
DRIVER              VOLUME NAME
local               5b0b65e4316da67c2d471086640e6005ca2264f3...
local               pgdata-prod
local               pgdata-dev
local               13b59c9936d78d109d094693446e174e5480d973...
```

Some of those volume names were explicit (pgdata-prod, pgdata-dev).

The others (the hex IDs) were generated automatically by Docker.

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Naming volumes

* Volumes can be created without a container, then used in multiple containers.

Let's create a couple of volumes directly.

```bash
$ docker volume create webapps
webapps
```

```bash
$ docker volume create logs
logs
```

Volumes are not anchored to a specific path.

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Using our named volumes

* Volumes are used with the `-v` option.

* When a host path does not contain a `/`, it is considered a volume name.

Let's start a web server using the two previous volumes.

```bash
$ docker run -d -p 1234:8080 \
         -v logs:/usr/local/tomcat/logs \
         -v webapps:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps \
         tomcat
```

Check that it's running correctly:

```bash
$ curl localhost:1234
... (Tomcat tells us how happy it is to be up and running) ...
```

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Using custom "bind-mounts"

In some cases, you want a specific directory on the host to be mapped
inside the container:

* You want to manage storage and snapshots yourself.

* You have a separate disk with better performance (SSD) or resiliency (EBS)
  than the system disk, and you want to put important data on that disk.

* You want to share your source directory between your host 


```bash
$ docker run -d -v /path/on/the/host:/path/in/container image ...
```

## Migrating data with `--volumes-from`

The `--volumes-from` option tells Docker to re-use all the volumes
of an existing container.

* Scenario: migrating from Redis 2.8 to Redis 3.0.

* We have a container (`myredis`) running Redis 2.8.

* Stop the `myredis` container.

* Start a new container, using the Redis 3.0 image, and the `--volumes-from` option.

* The new container will inherit the data of the old one.

* Newer containers can use `--volumes-from` too.

* Doesn't work across servers, so not usable in clusters (Swarm, Kubernetes).

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Data migration in practice

Let's create a Redis container.

```bash
$ docker run -d --name redis28 redis:2.8
```

Connect to the Redis container and set some data.

```bash
$ docker run -ti --link redis28:redis busybox telnet redis 6379
```

Issue the following commands:

```bash
SET counter 42
INFO server
SAVE
QUIT
```

## Upgrading Redis

Stop the Redis container.

```bash
$ docker stop redis28
```

Start the new Redis container.

```bash
$ docker run -d --name redis30 --volumes-from redis28 redis:3.0
```

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Testing the new Redis

Connect to the Redis container and see our data.

```bash
docker run -ti --link redis30:redis busybox telnet redis 6379
```

Issue a few commands.

```bash
GET counter
INFO server
QUIT
```

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Volumes lifecycle

* When you remove a container, its volumes are kept around.

* You can list them with `docker volume ls`.

* You can access them by creating a container with `docker run -v`.

* You can remove them with `docker volume rm` or `docker system prune`.

Ultimately, _you_ are the one responsible for logging,
monitoring, and backup of your volumes.

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Checking volumes defined by an image

Wondering if an image has volumes? Just use `docker inspect`:

```bash
$ # docker inspect training/datavol
[{
  "config": {
    . . .
    "Volumes": {
        "/var/webapp": {}
    },
    . . .
}]
```

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Checking volumes used by a container

To look which paths are actually volumes, and to what they are bound,
use `docker inspect` (again):

```bash
$ docker inspect <yourContainerID>
[{
  "ID": "<yourContainerID>",
. . .
  "Volumes": {
     "/var/webapp": "/var/lib/docker/vfs/dir/f4280c5b6207ed531efd4cc673ff620cef2a7980f747dbbcca001db61de04468"
  },
  "VolumesRW": {
     "/var/webapp": true
  },
}]
```

* We can see that our volume is present on the file system of the Docker host.

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Sharing a single file

The same `-v` flag can be used to share a single file (instead of a directory).

One of the most interesting examples is to share the Docker control socket.

```bash
$ docker run -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock docker sh
```

From that container, you can now run `docker` commands communicating with
the Docker Engine running on the host. Try `docker ps`!

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Volume plugins

You can install plugins to manage volumes backed by particular storage systems,
or providing extra features. For instance:

* [REX-Ray](https://rexray.io/) - create and manage volumes backed by an enterprise storage system (e.g.
  SAN or NAS), or by cloud block stores (e.g. EBS, EFS).

* [Portworx](https://portworx.com/) - provides distributed block store for containers.

* [Gluster](https://www.gluster.org/) - open source software-defined distributed storage that can scale
  to several petabytes. It provides interfaces for object, block and file storage.

* and much more at the [Docker Store](https://store.docker.com/search?category=volume&q=&type=plugin)!

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## Volumes vs. Mounts

* Since Docker 17.06, a new options is available: `--mount`.

* It offers a new, richer syntax to manipulate data in containers.

* It makes an explicit difference between:

  - volumes (identified with a unique name, managed by a storage plugin),

  - bind mounts (identified with a host path, not managed).

* The former `-v` / `--volume` option is still usable.

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]
---

## `--mount` syntax

Binding a host path to a container path:

```bash
$ docker run \
  --mount type=bind,source=/path/on/host,target=/path/in/container alpine
```

Mounting a volume to a container path:

```bash
$ docker run \
  --mount source=myvolume,target=/path/in/container alpine
```

Mounting a tmpfs (in-memory, for temporary files):

```bash
$ docker run \
  --mount type=tmpfs,destination=/path/in/container,tmpfs-size=1000000 alpine
```

.debug[[containers/Networking_Volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Networking_Volumes.md)]

# Docker Compose

Dockerfiles are great to build container images.

But what if we work with a complex stack made of multiple containers?

Eventually, we will want to write some custom scripts and automation to build, run, and connect
our containers together.

There is a better way: using Docker Compose.

In this section, you will use Compose to bootstrap a development environment.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Compose.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Compose.md)]
---

## What is Docker Compose?

Docker Compose is an external tool.

Unlike the Docker Engine, it is written in Python. It's open source as well.

The general idea of Compose is to enable a very simple, powerful onboarding workflow:

1. Checkout your code.

2. Run `docker-compose up`.

3. Your app is up and running!

.debug[[containers/Docker_Compose.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Compose.md)]
---

## Compose overview

This is how you work with Compose:

* You describe a set (or stack) of containers in a YAML file called `docker-compose.yml`.

* You run `docker-compose up`.

* Compose automatically pulls images, builds containers, and starts them.

* Compose can set up links, volumes, and other Docker options for you.

* Compose can run the containers in the background, or in the foreground.

* When containers are running in the foreground, their aggregated output is shown.

Before diving in, let's see a small example of Compose in action.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Compose.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Compose.md)]
---

class: pic

![composeup](images/composeup.gif)

.debug[[containers/Docker_Compose.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Compose.md)]
---

## Checking if Compose is installed


If you are using Docker for Mac/Windows or the Docker Toolbox, Compose comes with them.

If you are on Linux (desktop or server environment), you will need to install Compose from its [release page](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases) or with `pip install docker-compose`.

You can always check that it is installed by running:

```bash
$ docker-compose --version
```

.debug[[containers/Docker_Compose.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Compose.md)]
---

## Launching Our First Stack with Compose

First step: clone the source code for the app we will be working on.

```bash
$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/x300n/trainingwheels
...
$ cd trainingwheels
```


Second step: start your app.

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

Watch Compose build and run your app with the correct parameters,
including linking the relevant containers together.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Compose.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Compose.md)]
---

## Launching Our First Stack with Compose

Verify that the app is running at `http://<yourHostIP>:8000`.

![composeapp](images/composeapp.png)

.debug[[containers/Docker_Compose.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Compose.md)]
---

## Stopping the app

When you hit `^C`, Compose tries to gracefully terminate all of the containers.

After ten seconds (or if you press `^C` again) it will forcibly kill
them.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Compose.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Compose.md)]
---

## The `docker-compose.yml` file

Here is the file used in the demo:

.small[
```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  www:
    build: www
    ports:
      - 8000:5000
    user: nobody
    environment:
      DEBUG: 1
    command: python counter.py
    volumes:
      - ./www:/src

  redis:
    image: redis
```
]

.debug[[containers/Docker_Compose.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Compose.md)]
---

## Compose file structure

A Compose file has multiple sections:

* `version` is mandatory. (We should use `"3"` or later; version 1 is deprecated.)

* `services` is mandatory. A service is one or more replicas of the same image running as containers.

* `networks` is optional and indicates to which networks containers should be connected.
  <br/>(By default, containers will be connected on a private, per-compose-file network.)

* `volumes` is optional and can define volumes to be used and/or shared by the containers.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Compose.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Compose.md)]
---

## Compose file versions

* Version 1 is legacy and shouldn't be used.

  (If you see a Compose file without `version` and `services`, it's a legacy v1 file.)

* Version 2 added support for networks and volumes.

* Version 3 added support for deployment options (scaling, rolling updates, etc).

The [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/)
has excellent information about the Compose file format if you need to know more about versions.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Compose.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Compose.md)]
---

## Containers in `docker-compose.yml`

Each service in the YAML file must contain either `build`, or `image`.

* `build` indicates a path containing a Dockerfile.

* `image` indicates an image name (local, or on a registry).

* If both are specified, an image will be built from the `build` directory and named `image`.

The other parameters are optional.

They encode the parameters that you would typically add to `docker run`.

Sometimes they have several minor improvements.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Compose.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Compose.md)]
---

## Container parameters

* `command` indicates what to run (like `CMD` in a Dockerfile).

* `ports` translates to one (or multiple) `-p` options to map ports.
  <br/>You can specify local ports (i.e. `x:y` to expose public port `x`).

* `volumes` translates to one (or multiple) `-v` options.
  <br/>You can use relative paths here.

## Compose commands

We already saw `docker-compose up`, but another one is `docker-compose build`.

It will execute `docker build` for all containers mentioning a `build` path.

It can also be invoked automatically when starting the application:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Another common option is to start containers in the background:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

.debug[[containers/Docker_Compose.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Compose.md)]
---

## Check container status

It can be tedious to check the status of your containers with `docker ps`,
especially when running multiple apps at the same time.

Compose makes it easier; with `docker-compose ps` you will see only the status of the
containers of the current stack:


```bash
$ docker-compose ps
Name                      Command             State           Ports          
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
trainingwheels_redis_1   /entrypoint.sh red   Up      6379/tcp               
trainingwheels_www_1     python counter.py    Up      0.0.0.0:8000->5000/tcp 
```

.debug[[containers/Docker_Compose.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Compose.md)]
---

## Cleaning up (1)

If you have started your application in the background with Compose and
want to stop it easily, you can use the `kill` command:

```bash
$ docker-compose kill
```

Likewise, `docker-compose rm` will let you remove containers (after confirmation):

```bash
$ docker-compose rm
Going to remove trainingwheels_redis_1, trainingwheels_www_1
Are you sure? [yN] y
Removing trainingwheels_redis_1...
Removing trainingwheels_www_1...
```

.debug[[containers/Docker_Compose.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Compose.md)]
---

## Cleaning up (2)

Alternatively, `docker-compose down` will stop and remove containers.

It will also remove other resources, like networks that were created for the application.

```bash
$ docker-compose down
Stopping trainingwheels_www_1 ... done
Stopping trainingwheels_redis_1 ... done
Removing trainingwheels_www_1 ... done
Removing trainingwheels_redis_1 ... done
```

Use `docker-compose down -v` to remove everything including volumes.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Compose.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Compose.md)]
---

## Compose project name

* When you run a Compose command, Compose infers the "project name" of your app.

* By default, the "project name" is the name of the current directory.

* For instance, if you are in `/home/zelda/src/ocarina`, the project name is `ocarina`.

* All resources created by Compose are tagged with this project name.

* The project name also appears as a prefix of the names of the resources.

  E.g. in the previous example, service `www` will create a container `ocarina_www_1`.

* The project name can be overridden with `docker-compose -p`.

.debug[[containers/Docker_Compose.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Docker_Compose.md)]
---

## Running two copies of the same app

If you want to run two copies of the same app simultaneously, all you have to do is to
make sure that each copy has a different project name.

You can:

* copy your code in a directory with a different name

* start each copy with `docker-compose -p myprojname up`

Each copy will run in a different network, totally isolated from the other.

This is ideal to debug regressions, do side-by-side comparisons, etc.

# Introduction to Kubernetes

In this chapter, we will:

* Explain what is orchestration and why we would need it.

* Present (from a high-level perspective) some orchestrators.

* Introduce Kubernetes

## What's orchestration?

## What's orchestration?

According to Wikipedia:

*Orchestration describes the __automated__ arrangement,
coordination, and management of complex computer systems,
middleware, and services.*

--

*[...] orchestration is often discussed in the context of 
__service-oriented architecture__, __virtualization__, provisioning, 
Converged Infrastructure and __dynamic datacenter__ topics.*

--

What does that really mean?

.debug[[containers/Kubernetes_Intro.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Kubernetes_Intro.md)]
---

## Example 1: dynamic cloud instances

--

- Q: do we always use 100% of our servers?

--

- A: obviously not!

.center[![Daily variations of traffic](images/traffic-graph.png)]

.debug[[containers/Kubernetes_Intro.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Kubernetes_Intro.md)]
---

## Example 1: dynamic cloud instances

- Every night, scale down
  
  (by shutting down extraneous replicated instances)

- Every morning, scale up
  
  (by deploying new copies)

- "Pay for what you use"
  
  (i.e. save big $$$ here)

.debug[[containers/Kubernetes_Intro.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Kubernetes_Intro.md)]
---

## Example 1: dynamic cloud instances

How do we implement this?

- Crontab
  
- Autoscaling (save even bigger $$$)

That's *relatively* easy.

Now, how are things for our IAAS provider?

.debug[[containers/Kubernetes_Intro.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Kubernetes_Intro.md)]

## Example 2: dynamic datacenter

- Q: what's the #1 cost in a datacenter?

--

- A: electricity!

--

- Q: what uses electricity?

--

- A: servers, obviously

- A: ... and associated cooling

--

- Q: do we always use 100% of our servers?

--

- A: obviously not!

## Exercise 1

- You have:

  - 5 hypervisors (physical machines)

- Each server has:

  - 16 GB RAM, 8 cores, 1 TB disk

- Each week, your team requests:

  - one VM with X RAM, Y CPU, Z disk

Scheduling = deciding which hypervisor to use for each VM.

Difficulty: easy!

.debug[[containers/Kubernetes_Intro.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Kubernetes_Intro.md)]
---
## Exercise 2

- You have:

  - 1000+ hypervisors (and counting!)

- Each server has different resources:

  - 8-500 GB of RAM, 4-64 cores, 1-100 TB disk

- Multiple times a day, a different team asks for:

  - up to 50 VMs with different characteristics

Scheduling = deciding which hypervisor to use for each VM.

Difficulty: ???
.debug[[containers/Kubernetes_Intro.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Kubernetes_Intro.md)]
---

## Exercise 3

- You have machines (physical and/or virtual)

- You have containers

- You are trying to put the containers on the machines

- Sounds familiar?

## Some orchestrators

We are going to present briefly a few orchestrators.

There is no "absolute best" orchestrator.

It depends on:

- your applications,

- your requirements,

- your pre-existing skills...

.debug[[containers/Kubernetes_Intro.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Kubernetes_Intro.md)]
---

## Nomad

- Open Source project by Hashicorp.

- Arbitrary scheduler (not just for containers).

- Great if you want to schedule mixed workloads.

  (VMs, containers, processes...)

- Less integration with the rest of the container ecosystem.

.debug[[containers/Kubernetes_Intro.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Kubernetes_Intro.md)]
---

## Swarm

- Tightly integrated with the Docker Engine.

- Extremely simple to deploy and setup, even in multi-manager (HA) mode.

- Secure by default.

- Strongly opinionated:

  - smaller set of features,

  - easier to operate.

.debug[[containers/Kubernetes_Intro.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/containers/Kubernetes_Intro.md)]
---

## Kubernetes

- Open Source project initiated by Google.

- Contributions from many other actors.

- *De facto* standard for container orchestration.

- Many deployment options; some of them very complex.

- Reputation: steep learning curve.

- Reality:

  - true, if we try to understand *everything*;

  - false, if we focus on what matters.
